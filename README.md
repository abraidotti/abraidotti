# ðŸ˜» Hi, I'm [Sandro](https://alessandrobraidotti.com)

I build and secure network infrastructure at [Kintyre](https://kintyre.co).

My job includes a little app prototyping, a lot of DevOps, and making [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/) environments work smarter, not harder.

## What I develop

- React apps with AWS Lambda microservices

- infrastructure-as-code that I can stand up and tear down fast

- Python or Bash scripts that work on files and processes

- Splunk dashboards in XML

## Other code you might see here

- I love hacking. You'll probably see some Python scripts that craft packets with Scapy.

- Tutorials. I always commit these because you never know when you'll get back to that new language.
