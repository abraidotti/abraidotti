# ðŸ˜» Hi, I'm [Sandro](https://alessandrobraidotti.com)

I do technical consulting at [CDI](https://www.cdillc.com/).

My job includes clound-native engineering, app development, pentesting, and making [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/) environments work smarter, not harder.

## What I do as a DevSecOps consultant:

- Perform internal and external network and web app pentesting

- Develop React/Node/AWS apps and Python/NoSQL/SQL apps

- Construct Infrastructure as Code and virtualization with Terraform, git CI/CD, and VMware 

- Automate stuff with command line apps in Python and Bash

- Splunk (intransitive verb). While Splunking, I administrate, integrate, and make cool dashboards

- Perform enterprise-level advisory projects for secure, cloud-native development
